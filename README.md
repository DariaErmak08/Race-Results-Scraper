# 🏃‍♀️ Race Results Scraper

# 📚 Project Overview
This project is designed to scrape race results data from multiple public websites and compile the information into clean, structured CSV files.
It handles multiple pagination types, ensures polite scraping behavior (rate limiting), and saves two datasets: **race results** and **race metadata**.

# ⚙️ Features
- Scrapes race participant data: name, age, gender, finish time, overall placement, division, city/state/country.
- Scrapes race metadata: race name, date, location, distance.
- Handles pagination automatically.
- Polite scraping: introduces random delays between requests to avoid overloading servers.
- Saves output in organized CSV files.
- Well-structured and reusable codebase.

# 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.8+
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup4`
- `pandas`
- `time` and `random` (for request delays)

# 🚀 How to Run
```bash
